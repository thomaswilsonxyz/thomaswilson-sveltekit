On a recent holiday in The Lake District I wasn't able to find a complete list of the [Wainwright fells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wainwrights) online, in a concise way that I could use to track the height and location of the hills.  

A few hours in the morning later and I've compiled a list [here](https://github.com/thomaswilsonxyz/wainwright-peaks) on GitHub.  It gives you all 214 fells with their

* Name
* Height (Metres and Feet)
* Col & Drop heights (Metres)
* Location (Latitude/Longitude, Ordnance Survey Reference)

enjoy !
