The hard thing about most ideas is arriving at them.

Most ideas themselves are easy.  For example:

* Many smaller changes to software reduces the chance that a single change can break things.
* People who exercise more are more likely to live longer.
* Everyday somebody is discriminated against because of where they were born, who they love, or what they believe.

Always try to communicate clearly.  This is especially true when you're communicating with other people.

I am a recovering over-explainer.  

By always explaining and contextualising, I was communicating less clearly.

For a long time I would say (or write) an idea alongside the journey of how I got there, or the consequences/next steps. 

I thought I was making my point clearer.

I thought you always wanted to help someone think how you think, or understand why something is/not good/bad.

Sometimes you can dilute an idea, suggestion, or observation by explaining it.  It makes your point less clear.

Other times, the explanation is just too unfamiliar, and _you_ are the one with the expertise.

Either way, the explanation of the thing you're trying to say probably isn't as interesting (or relevant) as the thing itself.

Explanations can take up a lot of the air in a room.  They take time to say, and energy to understand.  That's time and energy that could be spent doing the thing you're saying.

As you become more of an expert, people (rightfully or not) expect you to have made the explanation or assertion.
