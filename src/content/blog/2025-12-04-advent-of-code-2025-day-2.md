A few hours of tinkering away with Ruby and I've got Advent of Code Day 2 sorted (using Ruby again!)

I'm sure the problems will end up impossibly hard for my human brain at some point in the coming week, but I felt like Ruby was really helping me through today's challenge - nice and concise code imo.
