I really had a streak going in March 2025, huh.

Here are some things I've been doing that *aren't* writing blog posts:

1. Taking photos of beautiful, natural thingsâ€¦ during daylight !
2. Putting everything I own into a thousand boxes.
3. Riding my bicycle without having to wear four layers.
4. Seeing family and old friends (some of whom have new family).
5. Finishing the most books in a single month of 2025 so far ("Pagans" by James Alistair Henry; "Inventing the Renaissance" by Ada Palmer; "How Westminster Works" by Ian Dunt; "Butter" by Asako Yuzuki; "Empire of Silence" by Christopher Ruocchio)
6. Stacking and re-stacking a thousand boxes as some errand requires some *thing* located in some *box*, some *where*.
