The problems are _definitely_ starting to get a bit harder.  I'm really enjoying stretching my brain, but I can definitely see why people start to duck out of solving the whole advent.

I'm lucky enough to have relatively uninterrupted personal time.  But unlucky enough to be rarely (if ever) expose to this kind of problem solving so it definitely feels rusty.

Glad I was able to find time.  Still glad to be working in Ruby.  Now I _definitely_ feel limited by my mental abilities rather than my ability to solve the problem.

I definitely made use of the `pry` gem to step-through some failing tests and examine what was happening.

Had to take a proper step back today, and pseudo-code what I wanted, and then re-implement it.  Real rubber-duck coding.
