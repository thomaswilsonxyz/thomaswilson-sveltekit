Yesterday I finished Day 4 of the 2025 Advent of Code.  I've been keeping a _Reflections_ section of the `README.md` for each day - and while doing this challenge I kept a strong focus on modelling the problem rather than the solution or implementation.  

By that I mean: yes, it's all string and character manipulation - but aliasing data and operations behind classes and methods that make "sense" allowed me to think and reason about the work more clearly.

I think I'm at about a week of using Ruby nearly every day.  Which is pretty cool!
