It has been 29 (twenty-nine) days since I last wrote and published something .  I have things I want to say but, even more, I have things I want to do.

Here are some of the things I've been doing instead of writing: 

- Planning a wedding (including building a bespoke website for the wedding)
- Planning a holiday for later this summer (Nantes, France)
- Watching one of my best friends got married
- Cycling (outside!)
- Sewing (wool trousers, a linen tunic shirt)
- Writing and journalling in my pen-and-paper book

These all sound like a life being lived.  The idea of pulling myself out to write on my computer has felt like a chore, so I haven't done it.  

But it's also broken a habit (or weakened a muscle, pick your metaphor).  And I'd like to get better at recognising interesting problems by writing about them.  

Maybe I'll wait for the days to get shorter first.
