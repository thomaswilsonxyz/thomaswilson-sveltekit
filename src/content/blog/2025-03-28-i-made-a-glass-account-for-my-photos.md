I've been getting more into photography over the last year.  I wanted a place to put my photos that wasn't "I guess I'll build my own blog (again)", and also wasn't an extension of Mark and/or people Mark approves of (yuck)

Anyway, I found [glass.photo](https://glass.photo/): "a home for our photography on the internet."

I align a lot more with their vision for a photo-centric internet community: independent, ad-free, well designed, and privacy respecting.  Of course this means it's a paid service, but at Â£40/year, I don't think I could spin up something better in a shorter period of time.  And also, I'm very okay to be part of a community of people who have *also* paid that money, to be part of that community.

Anyway, I'm over there at [glass.photo/wilsoncookphotography](https://glass.photo/wilsoncookphotography).

I've only posted a couple of photos there at the moment.  I'm excited to see how it's discovery and community features play out !
