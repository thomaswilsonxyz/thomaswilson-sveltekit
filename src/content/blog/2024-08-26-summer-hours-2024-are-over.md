Hello, again.

Nature is telling me that summer is over.  Or at least that calling this late August _summer_ is stretching the truth. 

The days are getting shorter.  The wind has a cold bite to it.  The squirrels want nothing more than to de-head the seeding plants and cache food anywhere in the garden.

Autumn is coming.  Famously the best season.  Other than summer. 

I want to write more, but the best way to start is to start.  This is my re-starting.

Long-live summer.
