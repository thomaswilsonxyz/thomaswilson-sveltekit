> These tools can generate almost effortless outputs. They unburden us from the abrasion of creativity and their generic-by-design results keep us cocooned from the risks of standing out. No one wants to make ‘ugly’ art, or a ‘bad’ website. But struggling and making mistakes is an important part of developing skills and – increasingly important – finding your own voice.

> As a result, my experience is that executives have an easier time doing strategy, but a much harder time learning how to do strategy well, and fewer protections to avoid serious mistakes. Further, the consequences of an executive’s poor strategy tend to be much further reaching than an engineer’s. Waiting to do strategy until you are an executive is a recipe for disaster, even if it looks easier from a distance.

I leave the group huddled around a phone reviewing the photos. I watch their smiles and walk away with a smile on my face.

> [R]evenue is not the same thing as profit, and Microsoft does not have an "artificial intelligence" part of its earnings. These numbers are cherry-picked from across the entire suite of Microsoft products — such as selling Copilot add-ons to its Microsoft 365 enterprise suite (The Information reported in September 2024 that Microsoft had only sold Copilot to around 1% of their 365 customers)… The fact that neither Gemini nor Copilot has any meaningful consumer penetration isn't just a joke. It should be sending alarm bells throughout Wall Street. While Microsoft and Google may make money outside of consumer software, both companies have desperately tried to cram Copilot and Gemini down consumers' throats, and they have categorically, unquestionably failed, all while burning billions of dollars to do so.
