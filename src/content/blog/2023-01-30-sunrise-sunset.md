tl;dr - I made a daily game to guess if a picture is sunrise or sunset.  [Here's the link](https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/sunrise-sunset).

Over the festive break I got into a discussion (?) with my fiancée.  She said that she could look at a picture and know if it was a sunrise or sunset.  I said she's wrong.  

Don't @ me, you know I'm right.  You think the tones of the photo make it obvious?  Doesn't matter if people edit their photos.  And also what colours?  Gold?  Orange?  You're kidding yourself.  You can't imagine not knowing what time of day it is, because you pretty much always know what time of day it is if you're outside.

Look, whatever.  So I built a Wordle-style (i.e. daily) guessing game where you're shown a photo of a sunrise or sunset, and asked "Sunrise or Sunset?".  

That's it.  That's the whole game.  [Go and check it out](https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/sunrise-sunset).

If you guess it right six days in a row by March 2023 then I'll buy you a four pack of KitKat Chunkies - the single best chocolate bar to have with a cup of tea.  You also have to be my fiancée.  Good luck beating those 1% odds !
