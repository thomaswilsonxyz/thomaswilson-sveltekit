This is a list of my favourite albums of 2022.  They're not the _best_ records, they're my favourite.  

In 2018 and 2019 I made a real effort to create some (nicely art-directed) lists like this.  Then I let them rot and for three years I didn't want to write another *favourite* post until the other ones were back online and beautiful.

I don't have to resurrect those past pages to start at making another one.  

So this is a brutalist, small list of albums I loved that were released in 2022.

Some of them stayed on rotation for months.  Some of them I wanted to keep special, and only played them on the good speakers through my dad's vintage B&O hifi. Some of them are records that I found myself thinking about a lot.  Some of them are records I struggle to recommend to people, but think they're just _good_.
