It's March 2024, I'm on a long weekend holiday in The Lake District and the Website Redesign Fever came over me.  

I think it looks good, or at least simpler. 

It reflects my continued radicalisation into Plain Text, informed (heavily) by [marginalia](https://www.marginalia.nu/). 

I also took this chance to bump from Svelte Kit 1 to 2.  [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) it is a framework for building websites with the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework, which remains my favourite flavour of frontend tool.

It's got a Dark Mode now:

As well as a light mode:
