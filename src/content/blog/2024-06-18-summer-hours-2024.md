It's that time of year when I intentionally set-aside the guilt of not writing all the blog posts I want to, in favour of spending time outside.  

In the great tradition, I'll be on Summer Hours for the next few months.  Spending times outside, ideally eating and drinking good food. 

In July I'm getting married - which I am _incredibly_ excited for. 

Around that, I'll be attending other weddings, spending time with family and friends, and lapping up what little sunshine as are bestowed on these Great British Isles.
