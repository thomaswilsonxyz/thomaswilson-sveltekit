As a novice software engineer I thought that problems were technical.  Or that the hard or "real" problems were technical. I thought that they were about knowing which steps to take, or the magic words that the compiler/runtime wanted me to type. 

As a novice software engineering leader, I believe that all problems are actually people problems. 

People might not understand the reason why they're entering magic words into the computer.  This can mean they write incomprehensible, insecure, or non-performant software.

People might think you're not treating their work as importantly as they think it should be.  They might start chasing for updates, or requesting lots of feedback.

People might think the thing you're doing is too short-sighted.  Or long-sighted.  They might start asking for high-fidelity estimates or mock-ups before that work would be useful.

There is a _low_ chance that somebody will say "I don't think you're treating my work importantly enough so may I please ask for a list of prioritised work for the next three months".  They might say or do other things.  Or they might _say_ nothing.

If you want to understand a problem, do the work of understanding the people facing, fixing, or creating a problem.  

To understand people, talk with them.

You should talk honestly.  

It is hard to talk honestly about some things.  Or rather, it is easy to be dishonest about some things.  Feelings, fears, and blame are some things I find it easy to be dishonest about. 

You should try to remove as much discomfort from dishonesty as possible.  Or honesty should be the most comfortable state.  

Do things that invite or encourage honesty with people.  This might look like asking someone if and why they feel frustrated.  

It might look like telling someone that it would feel uncomfortable to give them an honest answer.

If something prevents you from understanding a person, it stops you from understanding (at least some of) a problem. 

When you fail to invite, encourage, or demonstrate talking with people in an honest way then acknowledge and apologise privately, and then as publicly as appropriate.
