I went for coffee with a friend today.  We were talking about how to make sense of it all.  The big stuff.

We were talking about the things you should not burn: health, youth, relationships.  Those things will, if sustained, sustain you.  Or, more pessimistically, they are the things you will reassemble slowly if you discard them.

Take the time and hone the tools to sustain them.  It does not matter if they do not feel important on a Thursday lunchtime when the sun is out.  

We were talking about therapy being one such tool, and my friend stopped talking, laughed, and said "I'm just trying to be a happy meat sack".

It's good.  You're a biological machine that breaks down slowly (if you're lucky) over seventy-some years (if you're lucky) which will, if you're lucky, happen to your mechanical body before your neural one.  You're also an exceptionally *wet* meat machine.  We are wet, slowly failing degrading meat machines.

You can be a happy meat sack, or you can be a sad meat sack.
