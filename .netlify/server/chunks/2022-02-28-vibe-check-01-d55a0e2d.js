  return `<p>It\u2019s basically March and the days are finally getting longer!  On Sunday, the sun was up to greet me as I made coffee.  Tiny sweet peas and strawberries bud on the window sill.  The flow of spring into winter feels miraculous.</p>
<p>It\u2019s getting lighter, but it\u2019s secretly the coldest, wettest month.  That\u2019s how it feels, I\u2019ve no idea what the data says.</p>
<p>Things I\u2019ve done this month which have brought me joy:</p>
<ul><li>Consumed a full Christmas dinner for the third month in a row.  I cooked some of the best roast potatoes I\u2019ve ever made, and introduced three other people to their first meat-free roast.  </li>
<li>Went for a two hour walk in the Chilterns, and discovered a feeling wholly like the green Downs of home.  Walk was promptly followed by a Sunday lunch and glass of wine in a prop\u2019r pub, complete with locals, dogs, and an outhouse.</li>
<li>DM\u2019d my first ever game of Dungeons and Dragons, and I loved every minute, baby.</li>
<li>Took a four day weekend, for no reason other than \u201CI had leave to take\u201D.  The joy of taking an hour walk to read my book in a cafe, at two in the afternoon, while others worked.  Simple joy.</li>
<li>Discovered some <em>excellent</em> Columbian coffee from <a href="${"https://www.newgroundcoffee.com/shop/coffee"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Newground</a>.  Truly, it\u2019s like apple cherry coke.</li>
<li>Made my first Spring meal of the year (Anna Jones\u2019 <a href="${"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/vegetable-fritter-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Spring Onion and Pea Fritters</a>).  My favourite Spring meal remains pea risotto, cooked while consuming white wine.  Something to look forward to, brightly.</li></ul>
<p>We\u2019re now <em>in</em> to 2022.  It\u2019s begun, and the peace and hope of New Year\u2019s have fallen away.  I find my head more full of ideas and problems, of managing a maturing engineering team in a fast-moving organisation.  And also of a semi home-brew D&amp;D campaign.  Routine and way-finding are butting heads (I should write horoscopes).</p>
<p>To my delight, I find myself still reading.  Highlights this month include:</p>
<ul><li><a href="${"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/John-Gwynne/The-Shadow-of-the-Gods/25534879"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Shadow of the Gods</a>, by John Gywnne.  This is the first Norse-mythology book I\u2019ve read (sorry Neil Gaiman), and right now I\u2019m confused by all the names.  I\u2019ve got five hundred and fifty more pages to get familiar with it.</li>
<li><a href="${"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Cal-Newport/Deep-Work--Rules-for-Focused-Success-in-a-Distracted-World/17808018"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Deep Work</a>, by Cal Newport.  Extremely good, tyrannically anti social media in places, though. </li>
<li><a href="${"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish--Introducing-the-Witcher---Now-a-major-Netflix-show/24718223"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">The Last Wish</a>, after being somewhat baffled by <em>The Witcher</em> Netflix series, I find myself equally baffled by the odd dialogue in this collection of short stories.  Am I supposed to just <em>know</em> what a Bruxa is, Mr Sapkowski?</li>
<li><a href="${"https://www.waterstones.com/book/meditations/marcus-aurelius/gregory-hays/9780753820162"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Meditations</a>, by Marcus Aurelius.  It\u2019s not a book to devour.</li></ul>`;
