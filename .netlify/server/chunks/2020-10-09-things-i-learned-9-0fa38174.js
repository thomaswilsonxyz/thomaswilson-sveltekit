  return `<p>In honour of the announcement of (some of) the 2020 Nobel Prizes, this week\u2019s edition contains entirely things I learned when reading about the people and work announced so far. Note that this doesn\u2019t include anything about the Peace or Economics prizes, which had not been announced at the time of writing.</p>
<p>I also started a new job this week so I\u2019m running at 5-10% mental capacity so we\u2019re in for another short edition this week!</p>
<ul><li><strong>This line of poetry</strong>: from Louise Gl\xFCck\u2019s <em>Lullaby</em> \u201CThe Soul\u2019s like all matter: / why would it stay intact, stay faithful to its one form / when it could be free?\u201C. Gl\xFCck is an American poet who has been publishing poetry since the 1960s. She has also taught at various American colleges. Her work carries various first-person narratives, often looking at intimate human relationships.</li>
<li><strong>This weird name</strong>: Before we discovered Hepatitis C, we had only discovered Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. The thing about Hepatitis C, is that it\u2019s chronic and it doesn\u2019t present many immediate symptoms (but it\u2019ll still kill ya) and we just hadn\u2019t isolated the virus yet. Around the 1960s, doctors started noticing something Hepatitis-y in patients who had received blood transfusions, or therapies derived from blood. So for a while, actually about a decade, we called this new virus <em>Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis</em> (NANBH) when really maybe we should have just called it Hepatitis C from the beginning. This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Harvey J. Alter, Charles M. Rice, and Michael Houghton for their work in discovering Hepatitis.</li>
<li><strong>This use-case for genetic modification</strong>: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna for their work on Crispr-Cas9, a tool for gene editing. The <em>Revive &amp; Restore</em> project (<a href="${"https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">link</a>) is trying to use this technology to create a mammoth-like animal, using the Asian Elephant as a baseline. If this is successful, I put good money on someone farming these animals for food and selling Wooly Mammoth Burgers from a food van. Bonus points to that van being Flintstones themed.</li>
<li><strong>This family</strong>: The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez for their work on Black Holes. As a child Dr. Penrose, now a maths professor at Oxford, would go for walks with his family. During these walks, his brother and father would play chess entirely in their heads, and Dr. Penrose would run back and forth between them, relaying one\u2019s next move to the other.</li></ul>
<h2>What I\u2019ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong> <em>DEMOTAPE/VEGA</em> by BERWYN (Hip Hop/Genre-Queer). This is a personal album, BERWYN puts a lot of himself and his situation into it. It flits between genres but still makes a consistent rap-ish sound and story. This is a good album from a relatively new artist who\u2019s obviously got things to say and the ability to say them. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/berwyn/demotapevega"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong> <em>Wild Rivers</em> by Wild Rivers (Folk). With the shift of seasons from summer to autumn, it\u2019s a great time to be pensive. I\u2019ve always found folk music to fit this mood well, and this album has gentle vibes by the bucket.

<h2>Cool Articles</h2>

<li><em><a href="${"https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">The Widening Responsibility for Front-End Developers</a></em> by Chris Coyier for CSS Tricks. Every year or so, Coyier, puts out a really great essay on the state of modern web development, without bending to trends, companies, frameworks, or click-baity titles.

<li><a href="${"https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-life-cant-be-simpler/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Why Life Can\u2019t be Simpler</a> on the Farnam Street blog. This article is filled with tiny nuggets worth making a note of, especially if you\u2019re in the business of making anything. One of my favourite such nuggets is is that \u201Ccomplexity is like energy. It cannot be created or destroyed, only moved somewhere else. When a product or service becomes simpler for users, engineers and designers have to work harder.\u201D</li></ul>`;
