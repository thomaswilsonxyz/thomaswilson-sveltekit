<p>Stop me if you\u2019ve heard any of these: \u201Cyour call is valuable to us\u201D\u2026 \u201Con a scale of 1-10 how would you rate our\u2026\u201D, \u201Dat ${(0, import_index_10ac95e2.e)(companyName)} we care deeply about our customer experience\u2026\u201D</p>
<p>Have you literally ever believed anybody when you\u2019ve heard or read these things? I have not. Not even once.</p>
<p>But we should care. I know Oxwash does. We care a lot that people send us their wedding dresses, bedding, favourite band Ts and home team jerseys. It\u2019s one of the top three reasons I decided to work at Oxwash - everyone genuinely cares \u{1F499} I\u2019m a front-end engineer, I make software that real customers use every day, and I care that they have a good experience. At very least I care that we should know if our software is confusing our new customers.</p>
<p>\u{1F447} The good news is, it\u2019s actually really easy to stand out. Literally all you have to do is act like you\u2019re a human being who cares. So I\u2019m bringing <strong>four tips on how to talk with your customers like you\u2019re a human who actually cares about them</strong></p>
<ol><li>\u{1F575}\uFE0F\u200D\u2642\uFE0F <strong>Focus on who you want to talk to</strong>: You\u2019re not going to be able to talk to everybody all of the time. You have other things to do. I started talking to first-time Oxwash customers. It\u2019s enough that I\u2019m fielding e-mails every day, but they\u2019re not banging down my door. I think it\u2019s really important your software is understandable to first-time users. If they don\u2019t stick around long enough to learn the\u2026quirks of your system then there\u2019s a problem. You might care about your longest customers, or those in a certain age range or who work in a certain sector. Start small, you can always go bigger.</li>
<li>\u{1F916} <strong>Automate (but not too much)</strong>: How many e-mails in your inbox were hand-crafted and delivered by artisanal humans? Probably less than half. Use automation services to send-off e-mails based on database and software events. Use snippets (shoutout to TextExpander and SuperHuman) so that certain thing (like instructions on how to update your version of the app in the App Store) aren\u2019t hand typed every\u2026 single\u2026 time. But always, <em>always</em> put something hand-crafted into a reply, especially when someone\u2019s taken the time to send you useful feedback.</li>
<li>\u{1F381} <strong>Share your findings</strong>: We now run monthly reviews with product, strategic, and technical staff. Every single bit of feedback (critical and complementary), every suggestion, every point of contention is brought up and discussed with real humans so that we can do something with that information.</li>
<li>\u23F3 <strong>Respect people\u2019s time</strong>: Every e-mail I send asking for feedback always gives people the chance to reply with \u201C1\u201D, \u201C2\u201D, or \u201C3\u201D (which stand for \u201Cgood\u201D, \u201Cbad\u201D, \u201CI\u2019m too busy at the moment\u201D). I\u2019d love a considered and detailed response from every customer, but I\u2019ll settle for more data overall, if it means sacrificing a bit of depth. Trust me, people love telling you what could be improved, but rarely care to gush about your software to you.</li></ol>`;
