<ul><li><strong>This etymology</strong>: The word <em>apocalypse</em> comes from the Greek <em>apokaluptein</em>: to uncover, or reveal. This original meaning got adopted in bible translations in the context of <em>revelations</em> - which makes sense. Something have been revealed or uncovered. However, most of the revelations in the bible aren\u2019t\u2026 great news? So it started taking on a more negative, destructive tone.

<li><strong>These first festive TV advert</strong>: Having a heart-warming, mini-movie of a Christmas advert has become a staple in the past decade. My personal favourite is the animated woodland scene and accompanying Lily Allen soundtrack for <a href="${"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mer6X7nOY_o"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">John Lewis is 2013</a>.

<li><strong>This most popular nut</strong>: What do you think the most popular nut of Victorian England was? My gut reaction was peanut, all the other nuts seem a little too fancy or exotic for wide consumption. However it turns out that chestnuts were the most popular nut in Victorian England. So there\u2019s a nice bit of trivia for you, and also it\u2019s roughly festive themed. (<a href="${"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442131/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This science of snowballs</strong>: You know how some snow makes excellent, compact snowballs which are perfect for throwing, but some is either a fine powder or ice which can\u2019t be thrown for love or money? It turns out that the underlying physics behind snowballs relies on the pressure of you compacting the snow together, with your delightfully mitten\u2019d hands, allowing some of the snow inside the snowball to melt back to liquid water. Then when you stop compacting the snow, the lower pressure forces the water to refreeze into ice, and it acts like a cement or a glue to hold all the snow together. When it\u2019s too cold (and powdery snow), the pressure from your hands isn\u2019t enough to melt the snow, and if it\u2019s too warm then the.
