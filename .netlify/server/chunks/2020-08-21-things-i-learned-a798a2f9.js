One way to spot a mental crutch is to see where you reach for words like \u201Cinterestingly\u201D, \u201Csurprisingly\u201D, or \u201Cnotably\u201D. These all <em>hint</em> at a significance or meaningfulness, but don\u2019t actually clarify it.

<li><strong>This hot takeaway</strong>: Did you know that during the 1970s if you ordered a takeaway coffee it came in a styrofoam cup and a lid without a hole. If you wanted to drink your beverage, you had to take the lid off <em>and then put it back on</em> - can you imagine? Obviously impatient, the hardcore mobile coffee drinkers (think: taxi drivers) kept ripping holes in the lid to drink their Joe on the Go. Where there\u2019s demand, there\u2019s business and thus was born a <a href="${"https://designobserver.com/feature/coffee-lids-peel-pinch-pucker-puncture/39790/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">whole field of design</a> for designing the most safe and ergonomic way to drink coffee from a cup without having to actually take the lid off.</li>
<li><strong>This Frank etymology</strong>: \u201CLingua Franca\u201D describes a common language between a group of people. It emerged in the late 1700s and translates functionally as \u201CLanguage of the Franks\u201D, with <em>Franks</em> being anyone broadly from Westen Europe. The original Lingua Franca was a mixture of simplified Italian, Greek, Old French, Portuguese, Occitan (a Romance language spoken around southern France and northern Italy and Spain - <a href="${"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">wiki</a>) , Spanish, Arabic, and Turkish (<a href="${"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca#Etymology"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
