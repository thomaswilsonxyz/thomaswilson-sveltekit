  return `<p>\u201CIsn\u2019t it getting dark early ?\u201D - how I\u2019ve started at least half of the conversations I\u2019ve had this week.</p>
<ul><li><strong>This thing that spreads like a disease</strong>: Look, I was a germaphobe before it was cool. I was very aware of how one thing can spread from person to person. However this contagious model of disease doesn\u2019t just apply to problems caused by bacteria/virus/any other vectors. Obesity can spread like disease, where if your friendships mostly comprise of obese people who normalise a sedentary lifestyle, or poor diet, you\u2019re nearly about 170% more likely to be obese than if you weren\u2019t in these friendships. (<a href="${"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/should-we-treat-obesity-contagious-disease"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This gossip circle</strong>: In Europe and North America in the 1800s-1900s we used to have a tradition called \u2018Telling the Bees\u2019 where people saw it as incredibly important to keep the bees up to date with what\u2019s going on in your little provincial circles. Were there any deaths, marriages, children, etc. Though especially they were seen as a sign of mourning, with some people even bringing bees to a funeral. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019ve stopped doing that bit, but anything which helps us pay more attention to the wonders of bees is good - they\u2019re adorable <em>and</em> useful - how many of us can say that?. (<a href="${"https://daily.jstor.org/telling-the-bees/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This obligatory Covid thing</strong>: I took some time this week to ask why and how Covid actually spreads and how we trace that. Given the criticism of the track-and-trace system here in the UK, I wanted to know more about what they\u2019re trying to do, and why it\u2019s hard. It turns out the majority of new Covid cases are caused by a minority of people. A study in India found 8% of people with covid cause 60% of the secondary cases, with 70% of people not passing it on to anyone. Since the beginning of the pandemic we\u2019ve been focused on <em>Super Spreaders</em> and this kind of evidence suggests we should continue to maintain that focus. Well done to the 70% who effectively isolate, let\u2019s bump that number up. (<a href="${"https://vis.sciencemag.org/covid-clusters/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>These rules for artists</strong>: In 1960s America Sister Corita Kent, a teacher and artist, taught a creative class. She brought these ten rules to the classroom and encouraged students to internalise them. They\u2019re not just good for students, or young people - they\u2019re wonderful reminders about how to live, and ended up being very popular among artists. They contain little wisdoms we\u2019d all benefit from: \u201CConsider everything an experiment\u201D and \u201CBe happy whenever you can manage it\u201D. These rules were later attributed to John Cage, so go and read them and attribute them to Sister Corita Kent.

<li><strong>This old meaning</strong>: Did you know eye rolling was once a flirtatious gesture? Now it\u2019s used to express sarcasm or exacerbation, but go back a hundred years or so and all of a sudden you\u2019re making bedroom eyes \u{1F644} (<a href="${"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye-rolling"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li></ul>
<h2>What I\u2019ve had on rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong> <em>Detroit 2</em> by Big Sean (Hip Hop). I\u2019ve been a little late in listening to Big Sean - he got a shoutout from Eminem in <em>Kamikaze</em> - the album where not a lot of other artists got positive attention. This album is packed full of collabs and features - it\u2019s a big production hip hop album. It\u2019s definitely not my normal kind of Hip Hop but I\u2019ve been bumping it this week. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/big-sean/detroit-2"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>Angles</em> by Dan le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip (British Hip Hop). This, alongside Em, was one of my first introductions to hip hop/spoken word/poetry in music. It showed me that music can be serious and fun at the same time, that it can be British, and can teach something. Being 16 when this album came out I learned some things from it but, you know, you\u2019ve not <em>done</em> a lot when you\u2019re 16. Re-listening to it now (as a 28 year old) throws me back, but still speaks to me - which speaks to how truthful and personal the music is.

With a very different Christmas and New Years on the horizon for a lot of us, which we\u2019ve got the chance to really mishandle, this article takes a little look at how this might not be entirely unprecedented.</li>
<li><a href="${"https://uicoach.io/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">UI Coach</a> by Nero. This neat little site for improving your design skills generates you a challenge (e.g. \u201CDesign a goal management and sharing app\u201D), provides you with a colour palette, font pairing, and icon/illustration set. I firmly believe (past the complete novice stage) we learn the nebulous design skills by <em>doing</em>. This is a great idea.</li></ul>`;
