  return `<p>Summer has always been a time for <em>doing</em> and living.  It doesn\u2019t feel right to force at least one piece of writing out of my brain every week.  Discipline and routine are useful tools for living, but so is taking a summer break.  I\u2019m going out of office for the next couple of months, so I can focus on the latter.  I want long cycles, solitary train rides, food eaten outdoors, and adventure.  This is what summer is for.</p>
<p>So there will be less writing in public, and more living in private for a little while.  It\u2019s been a weird 18 months with a pandemic, but this year I feel I can have a more \u201Cnormal\u201D summer.  So I\u2019m going to do that.  Shame that I won\u2019t be going to Florence, though. </p>
<p>Take care and stay safe, I\u2019ll be back when the days start drawing in \u270C\uFE0F</p>`;
