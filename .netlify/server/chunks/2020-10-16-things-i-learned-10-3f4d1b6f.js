  return `<ul><li><strong>This Tiny City</strong>: St. David\u2019s is a city with a population of about 1,000 people. In 1886 it was stripped of its status as a city, being described as \u201Clonely, and the neighbouring district wild and unimproved\u201D. In 1994 Queen Elizabeth II requested it be restored as a city, and now it is. (<a href="${"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Davids"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This Terrible Surgeon</strong>: In the 1800s Robert Liston, a London-based surgeon, was famous for performing amputations quickly. This wasn\u2019t just a neat party trick, at a time when surgical complications would kill a lot of people, being quick often meant less pain for the patient and less chance for something to go wrong. Liston once conducted a leg amputation in 28 seconds, during which he accidentally took off the thumb of his assistant and frightened a spectator to death (I\u2019m not joking, he accidentally hit their coat with his knife as he was waiving it about, and the spectator literally died). The patient as his assistant later both died from infections to their wounds. Liston\u2019s surgery clocked up a 300% mortality rate.</li>
<li><strong>This Monastic Meal Plan</strong>: St. Benedict remains an influential figure in modern Christianity. He wrote a book (a really big book) on how to be a monk and how to run a monastery (which were, at the time, full of monks). St. Benedict thought that monks should have two meals a day, but sometimes one, eaten in complete silence except for one monk reading aloud from the bible. He had a surprisingly well-balanced nutritional plan: fresh fruit and vegetables, two separate dishes, about pound of bread, half a pint of wine (a <em>hemina</em> to be precise), and a except for the sick or very weak, \u201Clet all abstain entirely from eating the flesh of four-footed animals\u201D. (<a href="${"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This Play Houdini Was In</strong>: Houdini\u2019s business model was pretty weird when you think about it: do things that sound and look impossible, like escape from a sealed container of water in handcuffs, and make sure nobody figures out how you do it. Make it so cool and outrageous and impossible that people pay to see it. A very Victorian sensibility. In 1911, Houdini performed his famous <em>Chinese water torture cell</em> trick - in which he escaped from a sealed container of water (chained down, of course). He wanted to patent it, so that others couldn\u2019t copy it, but by filing a traditional patent he\u2019d have to reveal how the trick was done as part of the documentation. So instead, he performed the trick once, as a one-act play, to an audience of one. This allowed him to patent the trick as a performance, not as a device, and so did not need to provide any details about how it was done. Incidentally, no one figured out how he did this trick during his lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>This Reasonless Nudity</strong>: No one knows why ancient Greek athletes used to perform naked. It was so inherent to the culture that the Greek adjective <em>gymnos</em> (on which \u2018gymnasium\u2019 is based) means \u2018Lightly clothed or naked\u2019 - yet there wasn\u2019t a clear reason for doing it. They started doing it about 50 years after the first Olympics and just\u2026 liked it, I guess? One story goes that a runner tripped over his loincloth and died, another story is that one sprinter (called Osippus) won a race nude, because he realised it would help him run faster.</li></ul>
<h2>What I\u2019ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>The Quiet City</em> by David Wenngren &amp; Library Tapes (Contemporary Instrumental). This is such a beautifully atmospheric album, it\u2019s perfect to put on as the evenings get colder and the rain starts coming in. The entire album flows into itself beautifully, and the orchestration is superb. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/librarytapes/the-quiet-city"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>The Come Up</em> by J Cole (Hip Hop). I really love some classic J Cole, this album has such a classic boom bap production sound and style, and the raw energy of an early J Cole. His new stuff is great, he\u2019s got a lot to say, but his old stuff is great to remember too. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/j-cole/the-come-up"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li></ul>
