  return `<p>Following on from International Women\u2019s Day last week, news of Sarah Everard\u2019s body being discovered broke on the 10th of March, a week after she went missing from Clapham, London. There have been subsequent vigils (and protests) to remind us all that <a href="${"https://www.who.int/news/item/09-03-2021-devastatingly-pervasive-1-in-3-women-globally-experience-violence"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">violent and sexual crimes against women are under-reported and under-convicted</a>, and that any fair and just society needs to build systems that don\u2019t let people think (let alone know) that they can hurt or sexually assault another person and probably get away with it. It\u2019s a bit of a rough or tone-deaf transition, but let\u2019s look at some things I learned this week:</p>
<ul><li><strong>This charmingly pre-covid advert</strong>: I stumbled across <a href="${"https://preview.redd.it/7bip7x8yl5m61.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=861e8a1096d8b66130f925d70743c018b35e3afd"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">this advert</a> for Choices Hotels, which asked (presumably sometime in 2019) \u201CWhat\u2019s your 2020 Vision\u201D. Imagine giving your 2021 answer to this question to anyone from 2019, it\u2019d sound fifty shades of dystopian. My 2020 vision was mostly the inside of my house, and being genuinely excited when I could eat dinner outside or go for a walk (also outside). Anyway, what\u2019s your 2022 vision? Rats? Locusts? Black Mirror but it\u2019s real life? Personally, I\u2019m hoping the dead rise and consume us all.</li>
<li><strong>This surprise concert</strong>: Yo-Yo Ma, the famed American cellist, recently received the second dose of his vaccine (he\u2019s 65, which is pretty cool). He briefly set up shop in the waiting room of the vaccine centre for about 15 minutes, to play for the people waiting for their vaccines. As a classical musician, Ma has probably missed performing live to people, so I imagine this wasn\u2019t just a joy because he had received his vaccine.

<li><strong>This forbidden confectionary</strong>: It\u2019s illegal to buy or sell chewing gum in Singapore. You can buy prescription gum (like nicotine gum), but you have to get it from your doctor. Why is it illegal? Train vandals, that\u2019s why. In 1987, the government in Singapore funded a \\$5b railway system, and people kept vandalising the door sensors of these trains by sticking their gum to them. So the government looked around, at their gum covered pavements and train sensors and thought <em>enough is enough</em> and outlawed the buying and trading of chewing gum. The total ban was lifted, to allow for medical exceptions, in 1992 when Wrigley, of gum manufacturing fame, lobbied the United States government to explicitly name gum in a legal free trade agreement (the USS-FTA) between the two countries. Despite the country of Singapore having a population of some 3.2 million in 1992 (which would have been about half the population of New York City), the company defended their position. Likely because they didn\u2019t want any other country looking over at Singapore\u2019s infamously clean train sensors and asking if they should do the same.

<li><strong>These wine merchant scales</strong>: Lord Byron was one of our first celebrities, namely a poet and a scoundrel. Byron as obsessed with his weight and would travel, sometimes multiple times a day, to Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd, a wine merchant in Covent Garden, to use their scales to weigh himself. Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd also happens to be the oldest wine and spirit merchant in the UK, being founded in 1698, by the way. It being the early nineteenth century these scales weren\u2019t the little box that you stand on and look down at, hope in your heart, but rather giant versions of kitchen balancing scales, used for weighing wine barrels. Byron\u2019s weight reportedly varied from around 9st to 13st, and he appeared to have yo-yo\u2019d in weight for most of his adult life, starting at Cambridge University and up until his death (at age 36). With scales being so inaccessible, to know how much you weighed was itself a status symbol - and apparently, various members of the gentry (men and women) had their weights recorded in Berry Bros. ledger, though these records haven\u2019t all survived.

<h2>What I\u2019ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>Evering Road</em> by Tom Grennan (2021). Grennan\u2019s slightly gruff but clear vocals remind me of Dermot Kennedy or James Bay (in his first album). Evering Road is full of poppy ballads and I hope this comes to be one of my albums of Summer 2021. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/tom-grennan/evering-road"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>What\u2019s Going On</em> by Marvin Gaye (1971). My father actually recommended this one on his Facebook page and blog. This album is such a beautiful re-discovery, Gaye was just a talented man, the vocals, instrumentals, and production sit just right on this album. Seriously, the sax in <em>Wholy Holy</em>\u2026 my goodness. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/marvin-gaye/whatsgoingon"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">link</a>)</li></ul>
<h2>Cool Articles</h2>
<ul><li><a href="${"https://thejarren.com/group-messaging/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">The Future of Group Messaging</a>. This is a really great piece about the UI and UX of modern group messaging. There\u2019s not a lot to distinguish between how we communicate these days, but various platforms bring their own ideas of what is (not) important. Some focus on instant messages (WhatsApp, iMessage), inboxes (e-mail), or group chats (Slack). Most of these paradigms result in a user experience which is either a) a 90\u2019s-style online forum, or b) iMessage/Messenger chat bubbles. These don\u2019t reflect the way we do group messages these days: where four people are having three conversations at the same time but one of them is important. As a persistent de-railer of conversations, I contribute to the chaos this post tries to solve, by arguing for a better (more first-party and actually useful) threading metaphor, to allow these conversations to happen in parallel.</li>
