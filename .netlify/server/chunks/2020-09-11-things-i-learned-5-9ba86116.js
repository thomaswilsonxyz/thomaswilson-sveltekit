  return `<ul><li><strong>This missed opportunity to name something</strong>: Ping Pong is a weird name for a sport, right? Ping Pong is actually a trademarked name, but it\u2019s not uncommon to call a thing by a brand name: it\u2019s like Hoover vs. Vacuum Cleaner, or Kleenex vs. Tissue. The real-fun fact here is that in 1900 Slazenger, a sports company, filed a trademark for the term Whiff-Waff - and 120 years laters (somehow) <em>Ping Pong</em> prevailed while <em>Whiff-Waff</em> died out, despite the fact that it\u2019s clearly more joyful. (<a href="${"https://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tp-whi1.htm"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">link to an oddly self-righteous article</a>).</li>
<li><strong>This stone man</strong>: The Apennine Colossus (<a href="${"https://unusualplaces.org/the-appennine-colossus/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">link</a>) is a stone sculpture in Tuscany, Italy, which is a personification (embodiment?) of the Apennine mountain region. This is why he\u2019s really big, but also I guess why he\u2019s made of stone? The use of stone to represent stone is perhaps a little on-the-nose, but the piece is gorgeous and captivating.It was created in the late 1500s by a Flemish sculptor residing in Florence, and some people argue that if it placed in the Piazza della Signora (and not in the private garden of a Medici home some seven miles from Florence) it would be considered a masterpiece.</li>
<li><strong>This new word</strong>: <em>Farrago</em> means some kind of confused, haphazard, or disorganised mix - a word around which I appear to have been building a life philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>This set of tarot cards</strong>: Don\u2019t ask how I got here, but this week I learned one can purchase a Hello Kitty themed set of tarot cards for a cool \xA3250 (<a href="${"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/637754503/last-day-70-off-and-free-shipping"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">etsy link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This medical condition</strong>: Stendhal Condition, named after a French novelist, is characterised by dizziness, hallucinations, and heart palpitations which come on after being overwhelmed by the beauty of art. Amazingly, that means it\u2019s really common in Florence, Italy (<a href="${"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991758/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">link</a>)</li></ul>
<h2>Cool Articles</h2>
<ul><li><strong>What to talk about in 1:1s</strong> by Julia Evans on her <a href="${"https://wizardzines.com/comics/1-1s/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}"><em>wizard zines</em></a> site. I really like the simplicity of this piece - it\u2019s just a collection of example things you might want to raise to a manager, so that 1:1s can actually be useful to you in the 6-12 month time span, and not just a box to tick, or reason to spend time away from your desk.</li>
<li><strong>Against Waldenponding</strong> by Venkatesh Rao on their <a href="${"https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding"}" rel="${"nofollow"}"><em>Breaking Smart</em></a> newsletter. No one is quite sure on the effects of so much technology, content, and mediums (podcast, YouTube video, Netflix, Newsletter) on our brain. It\u2019s given rise to a counter-culture, which is almost a meme in some tech circles, where someone voluntarily completely disconnects and go to live in a cabin in the woods. This article argues against, and while I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all the points the author makes, I think it\u2019s an interesting counter point in a debate where I rarely see someone taking an opposing side.</li></ul>
<h2>What I\u2019ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>Pink Elephant</em>, by Stand Atlantic (Pop Punk). I adore pop-punk, and I think everybody should embrace their inner teenager. This album is cathartic and comfortably pop-punk, but even better than that, it\u2019s a great album in its own right - it doesn\u2019t rely on nostalgia or tropes. Put it on play and relive the vibrancy of being 17-19 again. (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/stand-atlantic/pink-elephant"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>Safe in the Steep Cliffs</em> by Emancipator (Contemporary Instrumental). I\u2019ve spent a lot of time this week needing music without words, and I\u2019ve been rediscovering a lot of my old favourites during my time at University. The tempo and beat of this album is great to head-bop to while you\u2019re in a flow state, but perhaps a little too-high energy of more cognitively intense tasks (<a href="${"https://songwhip.com/emancipator/safe-in-the-steep-cliffs"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">links</a>)</li></ul>
<h2>Cool Things</h2>
<ul><li><a href="${"https://mailchimp.com/presents/by-the-books/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">By the Books</a> - it\u2019s like the online experience of browsing a friend\u2019s bookshelf, but online. Created / curated by MailChimp.</li>
<li><a href="${"https://blobs.app/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">blobs.app</a> - soft and gooey blobs are becoming more commonplace in UI design. This little web UI will generate a simple svg (or Flutter) blob for you to use. I got this from the Smashing Magazine newsletter,</li></ul>`;
