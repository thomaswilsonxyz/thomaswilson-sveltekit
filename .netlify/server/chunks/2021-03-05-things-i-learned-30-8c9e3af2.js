  return `<ul><li><strong>These no longer fictional bridges</strong>: You know the bridges on the Euro notes? There are seven of them total (notes and bridges) which represent seven different architectural styles. They were originally designed in 2002 and were (at the time) fictitious bridges which didn\u2019t exist anywhere - so that no country felt special or left out. Robin Stam, an architect from the Netherlands, has gone ahead and designed and built them all irl, for cyclists to use. The money willed these bridges into existence, which is cool. <a href="${"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/euro-banknote-bridges"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a></li>
<li><strong>This mis-attributed quotes on 2021 coins</strong>: The Royal Mint is releasing a set of \xA32 and 50 pence pieces in 2021 with quotes from Lewis Carol\u2019s famous <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. It turns out that the people who chose the quotes didn\u2019t check their sources, and ended up using quotes from adaptations and derived work. They went onto Goodreads and copy-pasted, so from what I can tell The Royal Mint is run by thirteen year olds who left their homework until the last minute. I support the notion that we should never let a fact get in the way of a good story, so I think this is marvellous on one level. Maybe it\u2019ll be like the bridges and a Dutch architect will come and re-write Lewis\u2019 work for us. There you go, there\u2019s your coin trivia and your callback gag - this one\u2019s a twofer.

<li><strong>This Geocache</strong>: I know about geocaching, but I don\u2019t <em>know</em> about geocaching. I don\u2019t get it. The idea is simple: hide something somewhere (public or out of the way), then tell a select few people on the internet where to find it. You can also go find the things that people have hidden. It\u2019s like Pok\xE9mon Go but with real things (lame). One of the engineers who worked with the Perseverance rover (who has now landed safely on Mars, which is pretty cool) is into geocaching. As an homage to this, the team have printed a Geocaching tag (like a unique identifier) on the calibrating tools for the rover\u2019s equipment. When Perseverance gets to mars, it will take a picture of this equipment and send it back to earth - and that\u2019s the code people can use to tag/find/achieve (I don\u2019t know the lingo, sorry) the little cache. The question for me is if this is still geocaching, an not marscaching (marcaching?)

<li><strong>This heartening panic fact</strong>: Although mass panic and hysteria <em>did</em> define the early reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, at least in the UK (couldn\u2019t get flour or toilette paper anywhere), panic isn\u2019t actually the common or expected response to disasters. It\u2019s fun to stereotype and be pessimistic but the social normals that have emerged during Covid have been around patience, space, and understanding. The language we use can be direct (there is a pandemic wear a mask) or indirect (things are tough at the moment), but these qualifiers are normally followed with \u201Cso let\u2019s do something good\u201D. Yeah, we all get a bit annoyed sometimes and some people can\u2019t seem to understand making the slighted accommodation for others, but if you think about it - we\u2019ve done an alright job (except for the bit where we caused and then did not contain a pandemic). The interesting question here is actually why people act so generously, cooperatively, and altruistic during a disaster (like a pandemic, fire, or other natural disaster). From a purely game-theory perspective, acting in your own self interest during a crisis or resource shortage <em>does</em> make the most sense. Social creatures that we are, we\u2019re likely to copy these behaviours when we see then, but why are these norms short lived, not sustained? That\u2019s the interesting research angle from this crisis, I think. (<a href="${"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z.#Sec7"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">source</a>)</li></ul>
<h2>What I\u2019ve Had on Rotation</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>Bach: The Cello Suites - Recomposed by Peter Gregson</em> by, err Peter Gregson (2018, Classical). Bach wrote some banging cello suites, you definitely recognise Cello Suite 1 (famously in G Major). Gregson takes on the ambitious task of reinterpreting Bach\u2019s cello suites, and I don\u2019t know enough to explain why, but this album is stunning. It feels fuller, more harmonic, and less performative than the originals. Where the originals might be a spectacle, this album is immersive and surrounds me when I\u2019m listening. It\u2019s a good album to write to, and also a wonderful way to justify any expensive headphones or speakers you\u2019ve bought yourself.
