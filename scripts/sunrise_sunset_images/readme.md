You need to create an Unsplash developer account with API key ([link](https://unsplash.com/developers)).

To authenticate calls to the Unsplash API, you need to create a file called `environment_variables.py` to store your access and secret key:

```py
# environment_variables.py
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = "access_key"
UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY="secret_key"
```
